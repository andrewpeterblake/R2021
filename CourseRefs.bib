abstract = {In this paper, we develop algorithms to independently draw from a family of conjugate posterior distributions
 over the structural parameterization when sign and zero restrictions are used to identify structural vector autoregressions (SVARs). 
 We call this family of conjugate posteriors normal-generalized-normal. Our algorithms draw from a conjugate uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart 
 posterior over the orthogonal reduced-form parameterization and transform the draws into the structural parameterization; this transformation 
 induces a normal-generalized-normal posterior over the structural parameterization. The uniform-normal-inverse-Wishart posterior over the 
 orthogonal reduced-form parameterization has been prominent after the work of Uhlig (2005). We use Beaudry, Nam, and Wang's (2011) 
 work on the relevance of optimism shocks to show the dangers of using alternative approaches to implementing sign and zero restrictions 
 to identify SVARs like the penalty function approach. In particular, we analytically show that the penalty function approach adds restrictions 
 to the ones described in the identification scheme.},

abstract = {This paper studies the effects of monetary policy shocks using structural VARs. We achieve identification by imposing sign and zero
 restrictions on the systematic component of monetary policy. Importantly, our identification scheme does not restrict the contemporaneous response 
 of output to a monetary policy shock. Using data for the period 1965–2007, we consistently find that an increase in the federal funds rate induces a 
 contraction in output. We also find that monetary policy shocks are contractionary during the Great Moderation. Finally, we show that the identification 
 strategy in Uhlig (2005), which imposes sign restrictions on the impulse response functions to a monetary policy shock, does not satisfy our restrictions 
 on the systematic component of monetary policy with high posterior probability.}

  abstract={We consider default by firms that are part of a single clearing mechanism. The obligations of all firms within the system are determined simultaneously in a fashion consistent with the priority of debt claims and the limited liability of equity. We first show, via a fixed-point argument, that there always exists a \&quot;clearing payment vector\&quot; that clears the obligations of the members of the clearing system; under mild regularity conditions, this clearing vector is unique. Next, we develop an algorithm that both clears the financial system in a computationally efficient fashion and provides information on the systemic risk faced by the individual system firms. Finally, we produce qualitative comparative statics for financial systems. These comparative statics imply that, in contrast to single-firm results, even unsystematic, nondissipative shocks to the system will lower the total value of the system and may lower the value of the equity of some of the individual system firms.},
